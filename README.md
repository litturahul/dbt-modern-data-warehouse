# Modern Data Warehousing with dbt: Scalable Analytics Engineering 

This repository demonstrates my expertise in building robust, scalable, and analytics-ready data warehouses using dbt (Data Build Tool). It features advanced data modeling, transformation, testing, and documentation techniques, all following industry best practices for modern data engineering. The project highlights my ability to design modular dbt models, orchestrate ELT pipelines, and ensure data quality for business intelligence and decision-making.

This project specifically processes and analyzes digital marketing data from Facebook (Meta) and Instagram ads.
- Data Collection: Ad data is extracted from Meta platforms using the Fivetran tool, which performs regular, automated syncs according to configurable schedules.
- Data Storage: Fivetran delivers the extracted data in Parquet format to an AWS S3 bucket, ensuring scalable and efficient storage.
- Data Ingestion: A custom Python function loads the Parquet files from S3 into PostgreSQL tables, enabling structured storage and further processing.
- Transformation & Analytics: dbt is used to transform, test, and document the data, preparing analytics-ready datasets for downstream business intelligence.
- Advanced Analytics: The project includes a comprehensive EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) framework, as well as robust A/B and multivariate testing capabilities for marketing analytics.

## Key Skills Demonstrated:

- dbt project structure, modular SQL modeling, and comprehensive documentation
- Data warehouse architecture and schema management for scalability and performance
- Data quality assurance through rigorous testing and version control
- End-to-end ELT pipeline orchestration and automation
- Scalable analytics workflows
- Integration with AWS S3 for data storage and management
- Automated data extraction using Fivetran and ingestion with Python
- Support for EDA, A/B testing, and multivariate testing frameworks
