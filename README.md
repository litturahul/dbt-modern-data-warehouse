# Modern Data Warehousing with dbt: Scalable Analytics Engineering

Welcome to a showcase of advanced data warehousing architecture and analytics engineering, built with dbt (Data Build Tool) and designed for scalability, maintainability, and enterprise-level data quality. This repository demonstrates not only technical proficiency in dbt, SQL, and Python, but also deep architectural thinking, automation expertise, and a commitment to industry best practices.

## üèóÔ∏è Solution Architecture Overview

This project implements a robust, modular ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline that ingests, transforms, and analyzes digital marketing data from Meta (Facebook & Instagram) Ads. The architecture is cloud-native, leveraging AWS, Fivetran, and PostgreSQL, and is fully automated for production-ready analytics workflows.

## High-Level Workflow:

#### 1. Data Extraction:

- Automated, incremental syncs from Meta platforms using Fivetran.
- Highly configurable scheduling for near real-time data freshness.

#### 2. Data Lake Storage:

- Raw data delivered in Parquet format to AWS S3, enabling cost-effective, scalable storage and separation of compute and storage.

#### 3. Ingestion & Staging:

- Custom Python ingestion scripts load Parquet files from S3 into PostgreSQL, ensuring schema evolution and data integrity.

#### 4. Transformation & Modeling:

- dbt orchestrates modular SQL transformations, tests, and documentation.
- Models are organized into staging, intermediate, and analytics layers for clear data lineage and reusability.

#### 5. Analytics & Testing:

- Advanced EDA, A/B, and multivariate testing frameworks are built-in, supporting data-driven marketing decisions.
- Automated data quality tests and documentation ensure trust and transparency.

## ‚ú® Key Technical Features

#### Layered Data Modeling:

- Adheres to the Medallion Architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold) for clear separation of concerns and scalable model development.
- Folder structure enforces modularity (staging, intermediate, analytics), supporting CI/CD and team collaboration.

#### Advanced Macro Engineering:

- Custom dbt macros for dynamic column selection, PII masking, categorical detection, and statistical profiling.
- Promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and enables rapid model development.

#### Automated Data Quality Assurance:

- Leverages dbt_utils and dbt_expectations for rigorous testing (uniqueness, referential integrity, null checks, value ranges).
- Automated test execution in CI pipelines ensures production-grade reliability.

#### Rich Documentation & Governance:

- YAML-based schema and column-level documentation is auto-generated and version-controlled.
- Promotes data literacy, discoverability, and compliance.

#### Cloud-Native & Extensible:

- Integrates seamlessly with AWS S3 and PostgreSQL, but easily extendable to Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift.
- Modular Python scripts and dbt models allow rapid adaptation to new data sources or business requirements.

#### Production-Ready Engineering:

- Environment-specific configurations, quoting, and project structure follow dbt best practices.
- Ready for deployment in automated CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.).

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Best Practices Demonstrated

#### 1. Architectural Excellence:

- End-to-end ELT pipeline design, leveraging cloud-native patterns and separation of compute/storage.
- Schema evolution and versioning for sustainable data platform growth.

#### 2. Advanced SQL & Analytics Engineering:

- Complex window functions, CTEs, and aggregation logic for deep marketing analytics.
- Automated year-over-year, cohort, and attribution analyses.

#### 3. Macro & Jinja Mastery:

- Custom macro libraries for reusable, parameterized SQL generation.
- Jinja templating for dynamic, maintainable, and scalable code.

#### 4. Data Quality & Testing Automation:

- Automated data tests, assertions, and expectations for robust, error-proof pipelines.
- Integration with CI/CD for continuous validation.

#### 5. Documentation & Governance:

- Automated, version-controlled documentation for transparency and compliance.
- Data lineage and impact analysis built into the workflow.

#### 6. DevOps & Version Control:

- Git-ready project structure with .gitkeep and .gitignore for clean repository management.
- CI/CD integration for automated testing and deployment.

## üöÄ Advanced Analytics Capabilities

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Automated profiling, outlier detection, and summary statistics.

#### A/B & Multivariate Testing:

- Built-in statistical testing for marketing campaign optimization.

#### Dynamic Reporting:

- Parameterized models for time-series, cohort, and funnel analysis.
